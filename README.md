 Web-Scrapper
 Overview

The Web-Scrapper is a lightweight web-tracking and analytics system that helps website owners understand how users interact with their sites.
It combines a FastAPI backend with a simple JavaScript tracking script to collect data such as page views, clicks, scrolls, form submissions, performance metrics, and more.
The project also includes tools for real-time analytics, alerting, and data export — all powered by PostgreSQL.


 Key Features

 User Behavior Tracking – Captures clicks, scrolls, form events, errors, and performance data in real time.

 IP Geolocation – Enriches tracked events using IPInfo to provide geographic insights.

 Analytics Dashboard – Displays metrics such as pageviews, active users, top pages, and performance stats.

 Alerts – Create rules that trigger when metrics exceed thresholds (e.g., traffic spikes or errors).

 Data Export – Download analytics as CSV or PDF reports.

 Multi-Site Management – Add, manage, and monitor multiple websites from one dashboard.

 Real-Time Insights – See live data for active sessions, clicks, and page activity.

 Tech Stack

-  Backend: FastAPI (Python)

-  Database: PostgreSQL (async integration)

-  Frontend: HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript

-  Data Processing: Pandas, AsyncPG

-  Geolocation: IPInfo API

 How It Works

1. Tracking:
   Embed a small JavaScript snippet on your website.
   It automatically collects user interactions and sends them to the backend.

2. Storage & Processing:
   The FastAPI backend stores the events in PostgreSQL, enriches them with IPInfo data, and triggers any alert checks.

3. Analytics & Export:
   Access the analytics dashboard to view reports or download them as CSV/PDF.


 Roadmap

-  Implement full alert evaluation and notification delivery

-  Add user authentication and access control

-  Improve analytics accuracy (bounce rate, session duration)

-  Enhance frontend with charts, filters, and real-time graphs

-  Develop lead-generation and CRM integration

-  Add caching and rate-limiting for better performance
