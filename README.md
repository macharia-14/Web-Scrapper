# Project Functionality Documentation: Web Scrapper V2

## Introduction
The project is designed as a web scraper and user behavior tracking system that collects, stores, and analyzes user interaction data from websites. It consists of a FastAPI backend, a frontend serving static files, and a tracking script embedded in client sites.

---

## Detailed Features and Status

### 1. Backend API (FastAPI)
- **Implemented:**  
  - A FastAPI application with a modular route structure has been established.  
  - Database connection management is handled asynchronously with PostgreSQL.  
  - CORS middleware has been configured with specific allowed origins.  
  - Frontend static files and the main index.html are served by the backend.  
  - Routers for sites, tracking, analytics, export, and alerts have been included.

- **Working:**  
  - API endpoints respond correctly and integrate with the database.  
  - Startup and shutdown events manage database connections properly.

- **Not Done / Incomplete:**  
  - Export routes are included but need to reviewed in detail; their completeness depends on what needs to be exported.  
  - Explicit error handling and logging beyond basic print statements are lacking.

- **Suggestions:**  
  - Comprehensive error handling and logging should be added.  
  - Export functionality should be reviewed and documented.

**Completeness: 95%**

### 2. Site Management
- **Implemented:**  
  - Endpoints for creating, reading (listing and detail), and deleting sites have been implemented.  
  - The site model includes fields such as id, name, domain, owner, is_active, and created_at.

- **Working:**  
  - Site creation and retrieval function as expected.  
  - The deletion endpoint returns appropriate success or error responses.

- **Not Done / Incomplete:**  
  - Update functionality for sites is defined in the models but no corresponding route has been found.  
  - Validation and authorization for site operations are not present.

- **Suggestions:**  
  - An update endpoint for sites should be implemented.  
  - Validation and authentication/authorization mechanisms should be added.

**Completeness: 90%**

### 3. Event Tracking
- **Implemented:**  
  - A tracking script is served per site that collects detailed user interactions including pageviews, clicks, scrolls, form submissions, errors, and performance metrics.  
  - A backend API endpoint receives and stores tracking events.  
  - IP geolocation enrichment is performed using the IPInfo API.  
  - Alert checks are triggered asynchronously after event storage.

- **Working:**  
  - The tracking script reliably sends data using sendBeacon or fetch.  
  - The backend stores events with metadata and location data.  
  - The alert triggering mechanism is in place.

- **Not Done / Incomplete:**  
  - IP geolocation skips private IPs, and handling for localhost is commented out.  
  - Details of alert check logic and notification delivery are not fully visible.  
  - Rate limiting or spam protection on the tracking endpoint is absent.

- **Suggestions:**  
  - IP geolocation handling for local and development environments should be finalized.  
  - Alert evaluation and notification should be implemented and documented.  
  - Security measures such as rate limiting should be added.

**Completeness: 95%**

### 4. Analytics
- **Implemented:**  
  - An aggregated analytics endpoint provides metrics such as pageviews, unique visitors, sessions, bounce rate (placeholder), session duration (placeholder), top pages, referrer stats, device stats, real-time visitors, button clicks, form submissions, error count, average load time, click heatmap, and user journey.  
  - A real-time analytics endpoint provides data on active users, pageviews, button clicks, and errors within recent time windows.

- **Working:**  
  - Analytics endpoints query and aggregate event data correctly.  
  - Real-time analytics provide recent activity metrics.

- **Not Done / Incomplete:**  
  - Bounce rate and average session duration are placeholders or zero.  
  - Some metrics such as user journey and click heatmap may lack full frontend visualization support.  
  - Pagination or filtering on analytics data is not implemented.  
  - Caching or performance optimization for heavy queries is absent.

- **Suggestions:**  
  - Accurate bounce rate and session duration calculations should be implemented.  
  - Frontend components to visualize analytics data should be developed.  
  - Pagination, filtering, and caching should be added for scalability.

**Completeness: 80%**

### 5. Alerts
- **Implemented:**  
  - Alert rule models with conditions, thresholds, time windows, and notification emails have been defined.  
  - Alert checks are triggered asynchronously after event storage.

- **Working:**  
  - Basic alert rule data structures and storage exist.  
  - The alert triggering mechanism is present.

- **Not Done / Incomplete:**  
  - Detailed alert evaluation logic or rule processing has not been found.  
  - Notification sending (email, SMS, etc.) is not implemented.  
  - UI or API endpoints for managing alerts are absent.

- **Suggestions:**  
  - An alert evaluation engine and notification delivery should be implemented.  
  - API and UI for alert management should be added.  
  - Alert history and status tracking should be included.

**Completeness: 50%**

### 6. Frontend
- **Implemented:**  
  - Static files including index.html, CSS, and JavaScript are served.  
  - A tracking script is provided to embed in client sites.  
  - A single-page application structure includes multiple pages: Dashboard, Sites, Analytics, Realtime, Alerts, and Export.

- **Individual Pages:**

  - **Dashboard:**  
    Provides an overview with real-time statistics such as active users, pageviews, visitors, and button clicks, along with performance metrics, top pages, traffic sources, geographic distribution, and a recent activity feed.  
    **Status:** Mostly functional with real-time updates and data refresh.  
    **Suggestions:** More detailed visualizations and error handling could be added.

  - **Sites:**  
    Allows site management with a site list, add site form, and tracking script URL generation.  
    **Status:** Functional for creating, listing, and deleting sites.  
    **Suggestions:** Site update functionality and validation could be added.

  - **Analytics:**
