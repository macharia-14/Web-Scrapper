  Web-Scrapper
  Overview

  The Web-Scrapper is a lightweight web-tracking and analytics system that helps website owners understand how users interact with their sites.
  It combines a FastAPI backend with a simple JavaScript tracking script to collect data such as page views, clicks, scrolls, form submissions, performance metrics, and more.
  The project also includes tools for real-time analytics, alerting, and data export all powered by PostgreSQL.

  Key Features

1. User Behavior Tracking ‚Äì Captures clicks, scrolls, form events, errors, and performance data in real time.

2. IP Geolocation ‚Äì Enriches tracked events using IPInfo to provide geographic insights.

3. Analytics Dashboard ‚Äì Displays metrics such as pageviews, active users, top pages, and performance stats.

4. Alerts ‚Äì Create rules that trigger when metrics exceed thresholds (e.g., traffic spikes or errors).

5. Data Export ‚Äì Download analytics as CSV or PDF reports.

6. Multi-Site Management ‚Äì Add, manage, and monitor multiple websites from one dashboard.

7. Real-Time Insights ‚Äì See live data for active sessions, clicks, and page activity.

‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

-  Backend: FastAPI (Python)

-  Database: PostgreSQL (async integration)

-  Frontend: HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript

-  Data Processing: Pandas, AsyncPG

-  Geolocation: IPInfo API
  

How It Works

1. Tracking:
  Embed a small JavaScript snippet (system generated) on your website. 
  It automatically collects user interactions and sends them to the backend.

2. Storage & Processing:
  The FastAPI backend stores the events in PostgreSQL, enriches them with IPInfo data, and triggers any alert checks.

3. Analytics & Export:
  Access the analytics dashboard to view reports or download them as CSV/PDF.


Roadmap
-  Implement full alert evaluation and notification delivery

-  Add user authentication and access control

-  Improve analytics accuracy (bounce rate, session duration)

-  Enhance frontend with charts, filters, and real-time graphs

-  Develop lead-generation and CRM integration

-  Add caching and rate-limiting for better performance
