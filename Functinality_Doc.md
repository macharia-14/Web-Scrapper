# Project Functionality Documentation: Web Scrapper V2

## Introduction

This project is a web scraper and user behavior tracking system designed to collect, store, and analyze user interaction data from websites. It consists of a FastAPI backend, a frontend serving static files, and a tracking script embedded in client sites.

## Detailed Features and Status

### 1. Backend API (FastAPI)

- **Implemented:**

  - FastAPI application with modular route structure.
  - Database connection management with async PostgreSQL.
  - CORS middleware configured with specific allowed origins.
  - Serves frontend static files and index.html.
  - Includes routers for sites, tracking, analytics, export, and alerts.

- **Working:**

  - API endpoints respond correctly and integrate with the database.
  - Startup and shutdown events manage DB connections properly.

- **Not Done / Incomplete:**

  - Export routes are included but not reviewed in detail; completeness unknown.
  - No explicit error handling or logging beyond basic prints.

- **Suggestions:**
  - Add comprehensive error handling and logging.
  - Review and document export functionality.

**Completeness: 95%**

### 2. Site Management

- **Implemented:**

  - Create, read (list and detail), and delete site endpoints.
  - Site model with fields: id, name, domain, owner, is_active, created_at.

- **Working:**

  - Site creation and retrieval work as expected.
  - Deletion endpoint returns appropriate success or error.

- **Not Done / Incomplete:**

  - Update site functionality is defined in models but no route for update found.
  - No validation or authorization for site operations.

- **Suggestions:**
  - Implement update endpoint for sites.
  - Add validation and authentication/authorization.

**Completeness: 90%**

### 3. Event Tracking

- **Implemented:**

  - Tracking script served per site that collects detailed user interactions (pageviews, clicks, scrolls, form submits, errors, performance).
  - Backend API endpoint to receive and store tracking events.
  - IP geolocation enrichment using IPInfo API.
  - Asynchronous alert checks triggered after event storage.

- **Working:**

  - Tracking script sends data reliably using sendBeacon or fetch.
  - Backend stores events with metadata and location data.
  - Alert triggering mechanism is in place.

- **Not Done / Incomplete:**

  - IP geolocation skips private IPs but has commented-out code for localhost handling.
  - Alert check logic details and notification delivery not fully visible.
  - No rate limiting or spam protection on tracking endpoint.

- **Suggestions:**
  - Finalize IP geolocation handling for local/dev environments.
  - Implement and document alert evaluation and notification.
  - Add security measures like rate limiting.

**Completeness: 95%**

### 4. Analytics

- **Implemented:**

  - Aggregated analytics endpoint providing metrics: pageviews, unique visitors, sessions, bounce rate (placeholder), session duration (placeholder), top pages, referrer stats, device stats, real-time visitors, button clicks, form submissions, error count, average load time, click heatmap, user journey.
  - Real-time analytics endpoint for active users, pageviews, button clicks, errors in recent time windows.

- **Working:**

  - Analytics endpoints query and aggregate event data correctly.
  - Real-time analytics provide recent activity metrics.

- **Not Done / Incomplete:**

  - Bounce rate and average session duration are placeholders or zero.
  - Some metrics like user journey and click heatmap may lack full frontend visualization support.
  - No pagination or filtering on analytics data.
  - No caching or performance optimization for heavy queries.

- **Suggestions:**
  - Implement accurate bounce rate and session duration calculations.
  - Develop frontend components to visualize analytics data.
  - Add pagination, filtering, and caching for scalability.

**Completeness: 80%**

### 5. Alerts

- **Implemented:**

  - Alert rule models with conditions, thresholds, time windows, and notification emails.
  - Alert checks triggered asynchronously after event storage.

- **Working:**

  - Basic alert rule data structures and storage.
  - Alert triggering mechanism exists.

- **Not Done / Incomplete:**

  - No detailed alert evaluation logic or rule processing found.
  - No notification sending (email, SMS, etc.) implemented.
  - No UI or API endpoints for managing alerts.

- **Suggestions:**
  - Implement alert evaluation engine and notification delivery.
  - Add API and UI for alert management.
  - Add alert history and status tracking.

**Completeness: 50%**

---

### 6. Frontend

- **Implemented:**

  - Serves static files including index.html, CSS, and JavaScript.
  - Provides tracking script to embed in client sites.
  - Single-page application with multiple pages: Dashboard, Sites, Analytics, Realtime, Alerts, Export..

- **Individual Pages:**

  - **Dashboard:**  
    Overview with real-time stats (active users, pageviews, visitors, button clicks), performance metrics, top pages, traffic sources, geographic distribution, and recent activity feed.  
    **Status:** Mostly functional with real-time updates and data refresh.  
    **Suggestions:** Add more detailed visualizations and error handling.

  - **Sites:**  
    Site management page with site list, add site form, and tracking script URL generation.  
    **Status:** Functional for creating, listing, and deleting sites.  
    **Suggestions:** Add site update functionality and validation.

  - **Analytics:**  
    Advanced analytics with tabs for Overview, User Behavior, Performance, and Heatmap.  
    **Status:** Basic data fetching implemented; some charts and visualizations may be placeholders or incomplete.  
    **Suggestions:** Complete chart implementations and add filtering/pagination.

  - **Realtime:**  
    Real-time analytics showing live data for active users, pageviews, button clicks, errors, active pages, and live event stream.  
    **Status:** Functional with live updates.  
    **Suggestions:** Improve UI responsiveness and error handling.

  - **Alerts:**  
    Alert management page with add alert form, active alerts list, and recent notifications.  
    **Status:** UI present but backend alert management incomplete.  
    **Suggestions:** Implement full alert CRUD and notification delivery.

  - **Export:**  
    Export analytics data as CSV or PDF reports with date range selection.  
    **Status:** UI present; backend export functionality working but will be fully reviewed.  
    **Suggestions:** Implement and test export endpoints.

- **Not Done / Incomplete:**

  - No user authentication or authorization.
  - Limited frontend error handling and input validation.
  - No SPA framework used; manual DOM manipulation.

- **Suggestions:**
  - Improvefrontend for better UX.
  - Add user login and role-based access control.
  - Improve frontend code structure and error handling.

**Completeness: 60%**

### 7. Leads Generation Functionality

- **Implemented:**

  - No explicit leads generation feature or API found in the current codebase.

- **Working:**

  - Tracking and analytics could be leveraged for lead generation insights.

- **Not Done / Incomplete:**

  - No dedicated leads capture, management, or reporting features.
  - No integration with CRM or marketing tools.

- **Suggestions:**
  - Implement leads capture based on user interactions or form submissions.
  - Add leads management and reporting in the backend and frontend.
  - Integrate with external CRM or marketing platforms.

**Completeness: 10%**

## Overall Completeness Estimate: 70%

The project has a strong backend foundation with comprehensive tracking and basic analytics. Site management and alerting features are partially implemented but need further development. The frontend is minimal and requires significant enhancement to provide a full user experience. Leads generation functionality is mostly absent and requires substantial development.

## Summary and Recommendations

- Focus on completing alert evaluation and notification features to enable proactive monitoring.
- Improve analytics accuracy and frontend visualization for actionable insights.
- Implement site update and alert management APIs and UI.
- Enhance frontend with a modern framework and user authentication.
- Add security features like rate limiting and input validation.
- Develop leads generation features including capture, management, and integration.
- Document export functionality and ensure error handling/logging throughout.
